## 2. Frontend Architecture

### 2.1. Framework and Language
- **React with TypeScript:**  
  Ensures a robust, type-safe, and maintainable codebase.
- **Component-Based Design:**  
  The UI is divided into modular, reusable components (e.g. authentication forms, dashboards, learning modules, payment interfaces).

### 2.2. Key UI Components
- **Learner Home Page:**  
  - **Topic Overview:** Displays a curated list of topics (quadratic equations, integration, Pythagoras, etc.) with progress indicators showing whether the learner has not attempted, is in progress, or has met the curriculum/goal criteria.
  - **Pathways & Options:** Offers structured learning paths to prevent overwhelm while providing enough choice for exploration.
- **Progress Tracker:**  
  Visual elements (graphs, badges, status markers) represent the learner’s progress against curriculum standards or personalised targets.
- **Interactive Learning Modules:**  
  Dynamic quizzes and problem-solving interfaces that deliver incremental hints and step-by-step guidance.
- **Feedback Forms:**  
  Interfaces for learners, teachers, and parents to submit qualitative feedback and performance insights.
- **Payment Module:**  
  Interfaces for managing subscription options, processing payments, and displaying billing history.

### 2.3. State Management & Persistence
- **Global State:**  
  Options such as Redux or React Context API can be used to manage overall application state (e.g. user session, progress data).
- **Local State & Caching:**  
  Component-level state for immediate UI interactions and localStorage/IndexedDB to cache non-sensitive data like recent progress updates.

### 2.4. Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Offline and Performance:**  
  The app is designed as a PWA to leverage service workers for caching, offline usage, and improved responsiveness on mobile devices.

## 3. Backend Architecture & Multi-Agent System

### 3.1. Core Backend Services
- **API Gateway:**  
  A RESTful or GraphQL API will serve as the communication layer between the frontend and backend services.
- **Firebase Integration (Initial Phase):**  
  - **Authentication & Hosting:**  
    Firebase Authentication handles user registration and login. Firebase Hosting and Firestore (or Realtime Database) store user profiles, progress data, and feedback.
  - **Data Collection:**  
    APIs to capture both manual stakeholder input (from teachers and parents) and automated interaction data (quiz performance, session metrics).

### 3.2. Multi-Agent Intelligent Guidance System

The backend leverages a multi-agent architecture for delivering dynamic, hint-based guidance. This system is built using agent-building frameworks:

- **Agent-Building Frameworks:**  
  - **LangGraph:** Serves as the orchestration framework for agent workflows.
  - **LangChain:** Helps construct dynamic retrieval and reasoning workflows.
  - **LangMem:** Manages both short-term and long-term memory aspects for maintaining context across sessions.

#### 3.2.1. Agents and Their Roles
- **Context Retrieval Agent:**  
  - **Function:**  
    Implements an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution by retrieving context from stakeholder inputs, historical performance data, and curated curriculum content.
  - **Workflow:**  
    On receiving a learner query, this agent performs dynamic searches to gather the relevant context, which will be fed to the language model.
- **Reasoning & Guidance Agent:**  
  - **Function:**  
    Analyzes the learner’s input alongside the retrieved context. It evaluates the answer, determines if memory updates are needed, and formulates hints to guide the learner step by step.
  - **Workflow:**  
    The agent processes the student's responses, verifies correctness, and decides whether to provide incremental hints or update the learner’s memory (via LangMem) for future reference.
  
#### 3.2.2. Integrated Workflow
1. **Learner Query Submission:**  
   The learner submits a problem or question through the interactive learning module.
2. **Context Retrieval:**  
   The Context Retrieval Agent is invoked. It gathers context data from various repositories and returns augmented context for the query.
3. **Iterative Reasoning:**  
   The Reasoning & Guidance Agent takes the retrieved context and the learner’s input, processes them, and determines the appropriate hints or partial answers.
4. **Response Iteration:**  
   The system delivers a partial response with hints. Based on subsequent learner interactions, the agent iteratively refines the guidance until the learner achieves a satisfactory understanding.

  - Supports social logins as the platform scales.

### 4.2. Payment Processing
- **Supported Gateways:**  
  - **Stripe & PayPal:**  
    The system supports both payment gateways, with initial transactions processed in GBP. Future support for additional currencies and methods is planned.
- **Payment Workflow:**  
  Learners choose a subscription tier (freemium vs. premium), are directed through secure payment flows, and their subscription status is updated upon successful payment.
