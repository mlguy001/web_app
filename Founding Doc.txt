# Founding Document for the Personalised Learning Platform  
**(Focus on Mathematics for Secondary School / A-Level – Initial Launch in England)**

---

## 1. Vision and Mission

### 1.1 Vision  
Our vision is to revolutionise personalised education by developing a cutting-edge platform that adapts dynamically to each student’s unique learning needs. The platform will empower learners by providing not only intelligent, automated feedback but also by incorporating qualitative insights from teachers, parents, and caregivers through a robust, continuously updated database. We envisage an environment where learning is tailored in real time—adjusting both the content and the format (from short quizzes to extended problem sets) based on individual performance, engagement, and attention patterns.

### 1.2 Mission  
Our mission is to:  
- Enable every student to overcome learning challenges by first addressing foundational gaps before progressing to advanced topics.  
- Provide an adaptive system that, alongside automated feedback, accepts direct stakeholder input to continuously refine its understanding of each student’s learning profile.  
- Leverage an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates external data with real-time reasoning, ensuring that teaching is interactive, guiding, and proactive.  
- Maintain a scalable, cost-efficient, and extensible platform initially focused on Mathematics, with a view to expanding into additional subjects and geographical regions.

## 2. Core Platform Architecture and Functionality

### 2.1 Overall Approach: Database + Agentic RAG  
The platform will integrate two primary data sources via an agentic RAG pipeline:  
- **Stakeholder Input Database:**  
  A dedicated, continuously updated repository where students, teachers, and parents can submit qualitative feedback, observations, recommendations, and descriptions of learning difficulties.  
- **Automated Interaction Data:**  
  Data automatically collected from student interactions (such as response times, error patterns, quiz lengths, and engagement metrics) to inform adaptive adjustments.

Crucially, stakeholder input is stored separately and is integrated at runtime via an agent that retrieves and incorporates these inputs into generated responses, without retraining the underlying model.

### 2.2 Detailed Breakdown of System Components

#### 2.2.1 Data Collection Mechanisms  
**A. Manual Data Input:**  
- **User Interfaces:**  
  Separate portals/views for students, teachers, and parents/caregivers.  
- **Input Methods:**  
  • Text-based feedback forms  
  • Structured questionnaires and open-ended comment boxes  
  • Direct upload sections for documents or recommendations regarding learning difficulties or potential improvements  
- **Purpose:**  
  To record all stakeholder perspectives in a central database, capturing observations, recommendations, and assessments of student progress.

**B. Automated Data Collection:**  
- **Interaction Monitoring:**  
  The system automatically records details such as:  
  • Repeated errors on specific topics (e.g. quadratic equations)  
  • Response times for various problem types  
  • Patterns in quiz performance and session engagement  
- **Usage Analytics:**  
  Tracking session durations, navigation paths, and frequency of use to inform real-time adjustments in content delivery and quiz formats.

#### 2.2.2 Agentic RAG Pipeline  
Our system employs an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines retrieval with autonomous reasoning. Its primary features include:

- **Dynamic Retrieval:**  
  The system issues queries against both the stakeholder input database and the automated interaction data repository, retrieving historical performance data, teacher/parent recommendations, and relevant curriculum content.
  
- **Agentic Reasoner (Reasoner Agent):**  
  • A dedicated node that receives retrieved data and integrates it with system prompts.  
  • The reasoner agent “thinks” over the information—verifying consistency, comparing it against a knowledge graph, and refining the generated answer to reduce hallucinations.  
  • It utilises a chain-of-thought approach to iteratively refine the response. Importantly, the system is designed not to provide the full answer immediately. Instead, it initially offers partial guidance, hints, and probing questions that encourage the student to think and progress towards a solution.
  
- **System Prompts and Workflow:**  
  • The underlying language model (selected from a pool of closed-source and open-source options) generates an initial response using an augmented prompt that includes retrieved context.  
  • The reasoner agent reviews the initial answer, adjusts for inconsistencies, and may trigger further retrieval if necessary.  
  • The system always maintains a helpful and encouraging tone—it never criticises the student (e.g. “you should have known this”), but clearly explains prerequisites when they are lacking, and transparently guides the student through the learning process.  
  • The final response, after several iterative trials if needed, is delivered along with hints and prompts to encourage further exploration and understanding.  
  • The system is proactive: it actively monitors student engagement, detects when a student appears lost or overwhelmed, and intervenes with additional guidance, hints, or step-by-step questions. For high-achieving students, the system continually pushes further challenges.

#### 2.2.3 Curriculum Alignment and Content Integration  
- **Generic Curriculum Database:**  
  • A comprehensive repository that includes official guidelines (e.g. Ofsted recommendations), past exam papers, university entry criteria, and other standardised materials.  
  • Curated in collaboration with subject matter experts.  
- **Future Regional Adaptation:**  
  • Plans to segment the generic database into regional or localised versions that address specific educational requirements and local standards.
- **Content Curation Process:**  
  • Regular updates by educational experts to ensure that content remains current and aligned with emerging trends and exam specifications.

#### 2.2.4 Stakeholder Interfaces  
- **Learner View:**  
  • An interactive portal for students to access personalised quizzes, practice tests, and instructional content.  
  • The interface adapts the quiz format (short quizzes or extended problem sets) based on individual performance, attention span, and current learning goals.
- **Teacher and Parent/Caregiver Dashboards:**  
  • Dashboards that display detailed student progress, learning gaps, and aggregated feedback.  
  • Tools that allow teachers and parents to input qualitative observations, recommendations, and additional guidance that is stored in the stakeholder input database for use in refining the system’s responses.

## 5. Detailed Workflow and Use Case Scenarios

### 5.1 End-to-End System Workflow

1. **Student Initiation:**  
   - A student logs in via the learner interface and submits a query or begins a practice session.  
   - The query is processed immediately by the agentic RAG pipeline.
2. **Data Retrieval:**  
   - The query is converted into a vector and used to search both the stakeholder input database and the automated interaction data repository.  
   - Relevant historical performance data, stakeholder feedback, and curriculum content are retrieved and ranked.
3. **Initial Response Generation:**  
   - The chosen language model (from our pool of closed-source and open-source options) generates an initial response using an augmented prompt that includes the retrieved context.  
   - This initial response is deliberately not the full answer; instead, it provides hints and partial guidance.
4. **Reasoner Agent Intervention:**  
   - The reasoner agent reviews the generated response by cross-referencing it with the retrieved data and the official curriculum.  
   - If any inconsistencies or hallucinations are detected, additional retrieval or reformulation steps are triggered.  
   - The response is iteratively refined until it meets accuracy, clarity, and pedagogical criteria.
5. **Response Delivery:**  
   - The final, refined answer is delivered to the student, optionally with inline references to the original data sources.  
   - The system maintains a proactive and supportive tone, encouraging the student, offering hints, and guiding them step-by-step rather than simply providing the complete answer.
6. **Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement:**  
   - Teachers and parents access their dashboards to review student progress and provide further qualitative feedback.  
   - This feedback is stored in the stakeholder input database and used to update the student’s learning profile.  
   - Aggregated data over time is used to fine-tune retrieval prompts and the reasoning process, thereby enhancing personalisation.

## 11. Teaching Philosophy and Proactive Engagement

### 11.1 Proactive and Adaptive Teaching Approach  
The system is designed to operate not merely as a passive provider of answers but as an active, engaged tutor. Key principles include:

- **Guided Learning:**  
  The system will not provide a full answer at the outset. Instead, it offers partial hints and guidance over several trials to help the student arrive at the solution progressively.
  
- **Encouraging Tone:**  
  All interactions will maintain a supportive, helpful tone. The system will never say, “you should have known this,” but will instead explain prerequisites clearly and help the student fill in any gaps in understanding.

- **Active Intervention:**  
  The system will continuously monitor the student’s engagement and performance. If a student appears lost or overwhelmed, it will intervene proactively by offering additional hints, rephrasing questions, or revisiting foundational concepts.

- **Customised Engagement:**  
  The platform will use data stored in the student’s profile to adapt its teaching approach. For high-achieving students, it will push further challenges and provide opportunities for deeper exploration. For those encountering difficulties, it will slow down, reiterate key concepts, and offer step-by-step guidance.

- **Transparency and Clarity:**  
  The system will make its process transparent, explaining its reasoning and providing clear steps that help the student understand the learning journey. It will also clarify when prerequisites are lacking, ensuring the student is aware of what foundational knowledge may need review.

### 11.2 Implementation in the Agentic RAG Pipeline  
- **Progressive Answer Delivery:**  
  The agentic RAG pipeline is configured to deliver answers gradually. Initial responses provide hints and partial explanations, followed by further prompts as the student attempts to solve the problem.
- **Detection and Adaptation:**  
  The system’s analytics will detect patterns indicative of a student’s struggle (e.g. repeated incorrect answers or long response times) and automatically trigger additional supportive guidance.
- **Proactive Engagement:**  
  The system will not wait passively for a new query. Instead, it will actively prompt the student with questions to assess understanding and guide them along the path to a solution.
- **Teacher-Like Demeanour:**  
  Emulating a good teacher, the system will engage in a dialogue that is patient, instructive, and always aimed at fostering deep understanding rather than simply providing answers.
