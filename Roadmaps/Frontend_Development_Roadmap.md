# Frontend Development Roadmap for Learning Platform

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation roadmap for developing the frontend of the Personalised Learning Platform. The platform is a PWA focused initially on Mathematics for secondary/A-Level students, featuring interactive learning modules, progress tracking, multiple learning pathways, user authentication, payment integration, and communication with a multi-agent backend system.

### 1.2 Document Purpose
This roadmap serves as a comprehensive implementation guide, focusing solely on selected approaches and technologies. It provides specific implementation guidance and highlights important dev vs. prod environment differences throughout the development lifecycle.

## 2. Technology Stack Implementation

### 2.1 Frontend Framework: React with TypeScript
**Implementation Details:**
- Use React 18+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- Configure strict TypeScript options for maximum type safety
- Implement React best practices including functional components and hooks

**Why This Approach:**
- Component-Based Architecture aligns with our modular UI requirements
- Extensive ecosystem provides specialized tools for educational applications
- TypeScript ensures robust type safety and improves developer experience
- Strong PWA support meets our offline capability requirements

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- Development will use React Developer Tools and TypeScript source maps, which should be disabled in production
- Error boundaries should be configured differently in dev (with detailed errors) vs. prod (with user-friendly messages)

### 2.2 Build and Development Tool: Vite
**Implementation Details:**
- Initialize project with `npm create vite@latest learning-platform -- --template react-ts`
- Use Vite's built-in dev server for local development
- Configure build options for production optimization

**Why This Approach:**
- Extremely fast hot module replacement for rapid development
- Built for ES modules, optimized for modern browsers
- Simple configuration with native TypeScript support

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- Dev uses unbundled ESM modules for faster rebuilds
- Prod build creates optimized, minified bundles with code splitting
- Environment variables need separate configuration for dev (.env.development) and prod (.env.production)

## 3. Project Structure Implementation

### 3.1 Feature-Based Directory Structure
**Implementation Details:**
```
/src
  /assets         # Static assets like images, fonts
  /components     # Shared/reusable components
    /ui           # Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
    /layouts      # Layout components (headers, footers, etc.)
    /common       # Other shared components
  /features       # Feature-specific components and logic
    /authentication
    /learnerDashboard
    /topicExplorer
    /quizModule
    /paymentProcessing
  /hooks          # Custom React hooks
  /services       # Service abstractions (API, auth, etc.)
    /api          # API client and related utilities
    /auth         # Authentication service abstraction
    /payment      # Payment processing service abstraction
  /stores         # State management
  /styles         # Global styles, themes, and style utilities
  /types          # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils          # Utility functions and helpers
  /contexts       # React contexts
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Organizes code by feature for better maintainability
- Simplifies navigation and understanding of the codebase
- Facilitates feature-based development and testing

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- In development, may include additional folders like `/mocks` for API mocking
- Production build will need proper import path optimization

### 3.2 Component Architecture: Atomic Design with Composition
**Implementation Details:**
- Implement atomic design methodology with these component levels:
  - **Atoms**: Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, cards)
  - **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms (form fields with labels, search bars)
  - **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (navigation bars, topic cards)
  - **Templates**: Page layouts without specific content
  - **Pages**: Complete pages with actual content
- Use component composition over inheritance
- Implement render props or hooks for shared logic

**Why This Approach:**
- Promotes reusability and consistency across the application
- Facilitates component testing and documentation
- Supports the complex UI requirements of an educational platform

## 4. State Management Implementation

**Implementation Details:**
- Use **React Context + Hooks** for most state management needs
  - Create context providers for theme, authentication, and UI state
  - Implement custom hooks for accessing and modifying context state
- Implement **Redux Toolkit** specifically for complex state in interactive learning modules
  - Configure Redux DevTools for development environment

**Why This Approach:**
- Context API is sufficient for most state needs and reduces bundle size
- Redux Toolkit provides better tooling for complex state transitions in learning modules

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- Redux DevTools should be configured to be active only in development
- In production, ensure Redux middleware is optimized (e.g., disable verbose logging)

## 5. Styling and Theming Implementation

### 5.1 Tailwind CSS with Custom Theming
**Implementation Details:**
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- Extend Tailwind's theme in `tailwind.config.js` to include custom colors and design tokens
- Create a consistent design system using Tailwind's configuration

**Why This Approach:**
- Accelerates development with utility classes
- Ensures consistency through a pre-defined design system
- Reduces CSS bundle size through PurgeCSS
- Provides excellent responsive design capabilities

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- Development will use JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler for faster builds
- Production build will purge unused styles for optimal bundle size
- Consider source maps in dev but not in prod

### 5.2 Dark/Light Mode with CSS Variables
**Implementation Details:**
- Define theme colors as CSS variables in a base stylesheet
- Create a theme toggle component that updates the data-theme attribute on the document
- Implement a useTheme hook for accessing and modifying theme state
- Store user preference in localStorage
- Initially respect system preference via prefers-color-scheme media query

**Example Implementation:**
```css
/* Base theme variables */
:root {
  --color-background: #ffffff;
  --color-text: #1a1a1a;
  --color-primary: #4a6cf7;
  /* other variables */
}

/* Dark theme overrides */
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --color-background: #121212;
  --color-text: #e0e0e0;
  --color-primary: #6d8eff;
  /* other variables */
}
```

**Why This Approach:**
- CSS variables provide excellent performance
- Allows for dynamic theme switching without JavaScript recomputation
- Respects user preferences while offering manual control

## 6. Authentication Implementation

### 6.1 Abstracted Authentication Service
**Implementation Details:**
- Create service abstraction interfaces in `auth.types.ts`
- Implement Firebase authentication in `firebase-auth.ts`
- Create React Context for auth state in `auth.context.tsx`
- Export a provider-agnostic API in `index.ts`

**Service Structure:**
```
/services
  /auth
    auth.types.ts      # Interface definitions
    auth.context.tsx   # React context for auth state
    firebase-auth.ts   # Firebase implementation
    index.ts          # Exports the current implementation
```

**Auth Service Interface:**
```typescript
// Example interface design
interface AuthService {
  register(email: string, password: string): Promise<User>;
  login(email: string, password: string): Promise<User>;
  logout(): Promise<void>;
  resetPassword(email: string): Promise<void>;
  getCurrentUser(): User | null;
  onAuthStateChanged(callback: (user: User | null) => void): () => void;
}
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Decouples authentication logic from UI components
- Enables future provider changes without major refactoring
- Centralizes authentication state management

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- Development may use a mock authentication service for testing
- Production will connect to actual Firebase authentication
- Different Firebase projects should be used for dev and prod environments
- API keys and auth domains will differ between environments

## 7. Data Fetching and API Integration Implementation

### 7.1 Axios with Request/Response Interceptors
**Implementation Details:**
- Create a base API client with Axios
- Implement request interceptors for authentication tokens
- Implement response interceptors for error handling
- Create service-specific API modules

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
// api/client.ts
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// Request interceptor for auth token
apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});

// Response interceptor for error handling
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Handle unauthorized error
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);

export default apiClient;
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Centralized API client configuration
- Consistent error handling across all API requests
- Automatic authentication token management

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- Different API base URLs for dev and prod environments
- Development may use API mocking with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Timeouts should be longer in development for debugging
- Error logging should be verbose in dev but limited in prod

### 7.2 React Query for Server State
**Implementation Details:**
- Configure React Query with a QueryClient
- Create custom hooks for specific data fetching needs
- Implement optimistic updates for mutations

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
// App.tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools';

const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      retry: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 3 : 0,
    },
  },
});

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* App components */}
      {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && <ReactQueryDevtools />}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Automatic caching and refetching
- Built-in loading and error states
- Optimized data fetching with deduplication

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- ReactQueryDevtools should only be included in development
- Cache times and stale times may be shorter in development
- Retry behavior should be different (fewer retries in development)

## 8. Component Design System Implementation

### 8.1 Custom Component Library with Headless UI
**Implementation Details:**
- Use Headless UI or Radix UI for accessible, unstyled components
- Apply Tailwind classes for styling
- Set up Storybook for component development and documentation

**Component Development Workflow:**
1. Start with Headless UI or Radix UI component
2. Apply custom Tailwind styling
3. Create stories in Storybook
4. Write unit tests with React Testing Library

**Why This Approach:**
- Full design control while ensuring accessibility
- Consistent user experience across the application
- Documented, reusable component library

**Dev vs. Prod Considerations:**
- Storybook is a development-only tool and won't be included in production builds
- Component debugging tools should be disabled in production

### 8.2 Core Components to Implement

## 14. Development and Production Environment Differences

### 14.1 Key Differences Between Dev and Prod
| Aspect | Development Environment | Production Environment |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| API Endpoints | Local or development API | Production API endpoints |
| Authentication | May use emulators or test accounts | Connects to production auth services |
| Error Handling | Verbose errors with stack traces | User-friendly error messages without technical details |
| Performance | Unminified code with source maps | Minified, optimized bundles |
| Feature Flags | Development features enabled | Only stable features enabled |
| Logging | Detailed logging to console | Minimal logging, possibly to monitoring service |
| Analytics | Disabled or sandboxed | Fully enabled |

### 14.2 Environment-Specific Configuration
**Implementation Details:**
- Use `.env.development` and `.env.production` files for environment variables
- Implement feature flags system for environment-specific features
- Create environment-aware service factories

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
// config.ts
interface Config {
  apiUrl: string;
  authDomain: string;
  featureFlags: {
    newQuizInterface: boolean;
    advancedAnalytics: boolean;
  };
}

const devConfig: Config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://dev-api.learning-platform.com',
  authDomain: 'dev.learning-platform.com',
  featureFlags: {
    newQuizInterface: true,
    advancedAnalytics: false,
  },
};

const prodConfig: Config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://api.learning-platform.com',
  authDomain: 'learning-platform.com',
  featureFlags: {
    newQuizInterface: false,
    advancedAnalytics: true,
  },
};

export const config = 
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? prodConfig : devConfig;
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Prevents accidental use of development features in production
- Makes environment differences explicit and manageable
- Facilitates testing of production-only features in development

## 15. Development Workflow
