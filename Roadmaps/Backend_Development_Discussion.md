# Backend Development Discussion for Learning Platform

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview
This document outlines the technology choices and architectural decisions for developing the backend of the Personalised Learning Platform, a PWA focused initially on Mathematics for secondary/A-Level students. The backend will support interactive learning modules, progress tracking, multiple learning pathways, user authentication, payment integration, and most crucially, a multi-agent system for intelligent, personalized learning guidance.

### 1.2 Document Purpose
This discussion serves as a comprehensive guide for backend development decisions, explaining the rationale behind technology choices, architectural patterns, and implementation strategies. It provides a reference for maintaining consistent development practices throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. Technology Stack Selection

### 2.1 Core Backend Framework

#### Recommendation: Python with FastAPI
Python with FastAPI is recommended as the primary backend framework for this project based on several factors:

- **Superior AI/ML Ecosystem**: Python's rich ecosystem for machine learning, AI, and data processing is ideal for our multi-agent system implementation.
- **LangChain/LangGraph Native Support**: These frameworks work most seamlessly with Python, reducing friction in development.
